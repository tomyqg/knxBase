.Sh NAME
.Nm knxipbridge
.Nd eib/knx bridge between simulated internal bus and ip protocol
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Fl H Ar hostname
.Op Fl Q Ar queueId
.Op Fl ?

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command
is used to establish a bridge between the ip world and an internal store and forward buffer.
This command requires an established internal store and forward buffer, which is identified by the
queue identifier (default: 10031). 
.Pp
If
.Nm
is invoked without the
.Ar queueId
argument, the queueId is set to the default of 10031.
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl D Ar debugLevel
Sets the debugging level to debugLevel. A debug level of 0 is the default. The higher the debug level is, the more
output will be generated. For a production service this value should be set to 0, i.e. not specified.
.Ar atype
type of authentication.
.It Fl H Ar hostname
Sets up a communication channel towards a knxipbridge server located on
.Ar  hostanme
.
.It Fl Q Ar queueId
Set the queue identifier to the given value. Usually it is ok to run with the default (10031). If you are testing
the knxipbridge on a single machine for example you need to have two internal store and forward queues. In this case it has proven
to use queueId=1 for the server side and queueId=2 for the client side.
output vwill be generated.
.Ar queueId
is the identifier for the store and forward queue
.El
.Pp
Starts the daemon process IP <-> SimEIB/KNX in user space.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
uses at least the
.Ev HOME ,
.Ev SHELL ,
.Ev DISPLAY ,
and
.Ev TERM
environment variables.
Other environment variables may be propagated
to the other side via the
.Dv TELNET ENVIRON
option.

command was developer by wimtecc, Karl-Heinz Welter.
.Sh NOTES
WHen compiled on MacOS, TPUART will run in simulated mode only.
