Checklist for mas core installation:
====================================

The mas application framework is sensitive when it comes to configuration. A configuration error
will either not produce any output at all or lead to an error message in the logfile (typically /tmp/php.log)
and/or in the browser.
The configuration should be carefully examined in case the expected behaviour or output in the browser
is not achieved.

1. Check that "Config/config.ini" contains correct data for:
	- database server
	- following parameters need to be defined even if these are empty:
		[dbSys]
		alias		=	"sys"
		host		=	"HOST"
		user		=	"DBUSER"
		password	=	"DBUSERPASSWORD"
		name		=	"mas_sys"
		driver		=	"mysql"
		prefix		=	""
	- following parameter related to server needs to be defined:
		[server]
		allowedHost	=	"wimtecc.de.local"
	  if the URL you type in is: http://abc.def.de/ the string needs to be:
		allowedHHost	=	"def.de"
	- following parameter for session needs to be defined:
		[session]
		timeout		=	900		; session timeout in seconds; 900 = 15 minutes
	- Try to "ping" the server HOST. If it does not respond ... fix it.

2. Check that the mas_sys database on the server as configured per "Config/config.ini" contains correct data for:
	- the table ApplicationSystem
	- the table Application
	- the table Client, especially the attribute "Server" needs to contain some valid part from the URL. If the URL
	  you type is http://abc.def.de/ the the Server needs to contain a part which reads:
		",abc,"
	- the table ClientApplication needs an entry for every
		ClientId / UserId / ApplicationSystemId / ApplicationId with a proper "PathApplication"
	  combination which specifies which user is allowed to work for which client and use which application
	- the table SysConfigObj contains a correct values for:
		dbAlias, dbDriver, dbHost, dbName, dbPassword, dbPrefix, dbUser
	  each for the Class="def" and Block="appSys" entries as well as the Class="def" and Block="def".
	  There must be at least 14 (! 2 x 7) SysConfigObj entries for an application to work!
	- the table SysUser needs an entry for every
		UserId / ApplicationSystemId / ApplicationId / Password
	  to allow this user to log in through the mas system OR an entry for
		__appuser__ / ApplicationSystemId / ApplicationId / <Password not required>
	  in case the use shall authenticate via the application system.
	- the table SysUser also needs an entry in case job automation is required:
		__steve__ / ApplicationSystemId / ApplicationId / __jobs__

3. Check that the Apache web server configuration is ok.
	- there MUST be an Alias for "/api" defined which points to base-directory/api
		this ensures that api calls "land" in the proper directory
	- DocumentRoot MUST point to base-directory/apps
		this ensures that only data from this directory or from a directory below
		can be served as answer to a request
	- there MUST be a Directory entry for the base-directory

Once the above mentioned checks have been positively confirmed there should be no reason why the application doesn't work.
