If you try to reload the page, or leave the page entirely by entering a new URL into the browsers URL field you will be prompted
to confirm this leave request. This has been implemented in order to loose unsaved data and avoid unintentional page reloads,
e.g. on Mac OS by simply swiping one finger on the Magic Mouse to the left.
