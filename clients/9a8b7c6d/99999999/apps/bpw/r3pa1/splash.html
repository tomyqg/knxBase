<h1>EgBrake Version 3 Brake Calculator, <i>Design Study</i></h1>
This version is based on a totally new database design.<br/>
Database will be adjusted as we go along with the calculation, which is the central issue of this study.<br/>
Please note that there are design elements on the HTML pages which are not part of the design but which are
solely for debugging purposes, e.g. the red boxes around certain elements.<br/>
<br/>
If you try to reload the page, or leave the page entirely by entering a new URL into the browsers URL field you will be prompted
to confirm this leave request. This has been implemented in order to loose unsaved data and avoid unintentional page reloads,
e.g. on Mac OS by simply swiping one finger on the Magic Mouse to the left.
