<h1>EgBrake Brake Calculator</h1>
This data editor is compatible to the EgBrake 2.17.x databases.<br/>
Do <b>not</b> try to edit any earlier or later database versions with this editor as
doing so will most certainly destroy your data and make it unusable.<br/>
The different screen masks will be loaded on first selection.
Until fully loaded you will see a short message in the top left
corner of the centre screen.
Once loaded the mask will
be displayed and you can view and - if your user account is authorized
accordingly - edit data.
